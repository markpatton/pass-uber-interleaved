/**
 * Accepts an object representing the status of some entity, and attempts to map the status to a
 * {@link DepositStatus}.  The status of the entity being mapped will have some kind of relationship with
 * a PASS {@code Deposit}.  That is, the value of the returned {@code DepositStatus} is a function of the status of
 * the entity
 * being mapped.
 * <p>
 * The entity being mapped from may be another PASS entity, for example, using a {@link RepositoryCopy#getCopyStatus()
 * RepositoryCopy copyStatus} to determine the status of its {@code Deposit}.  The entity being mapped from may not
 * be a PASS entity.  For example, DSpace provides an Atom feed in response to SWORD deposits, which contain a status
 * string.  This interface can be used to map from the status represented in the Atom feed to a PASS {@code
 * DepositStatus}
