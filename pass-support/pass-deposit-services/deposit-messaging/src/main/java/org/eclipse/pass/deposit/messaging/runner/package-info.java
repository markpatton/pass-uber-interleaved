/**
 * Provides classes used by Spring Boot to run components of Deposit Services.
 * <p>
 * Runners are used to identify and process {@code Deposit} resources that are in an unknown (i.e. <em>dirty</em>) or
 * <em>intermediate</em> state, in an effort to determine their <em>terminal</em> state.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link org.eclipse.pass.deposit.messaging.runner.FailedDepositRunner} identifies and processes
 * <em>dirty</em> {@link org.dataconservancy.pass.model.Deposit}s by re-submitting the {@code Deposit} and its
 * associated {@code Submission} as a {@link org.eclipse.pass.deposit.messaging.service.DepositTask}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link org.eclipse.pass.deposit.messaging.runner.SubmittedUpdateRunner} identifies and processes {@link
 * org.dataconservancy.pass.model.Deposit}s in an <em>intermediate</em> (e.g.
 * {@link org.dataconservancy.pass.model.Deposit.DepositStatus#SUBMITTED}) state, and attempts to resolve their
 * <em>terminal</em> by inspecting deposit status references or any {@link
 * org.dataconservancy.pass.model.RepositoryCopy} {@link org.dataconservancy.pass.model.RepositoryCopy.CopyStatus}
