/**
 * Filters a list of notification recipients against a whitelist.
 * <p>
 * Provided a collection notification recipients, this function will determine which recipients are eligible for
 * receiving the notification (i.e. whitelisted recipients), and return a collection containing the whitelisted
 * addresses.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The whitelist is configured in the notification services {@link RecipientConfig recipient configuration}.
 * If the configured whitelist is empty, then all notification recipients are considered to be whitelisted.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A practical configuration is to use an empty whitelist in production, but provide a whitelist when performing
 * testing or demonstrations, preventing notifications from being sent to recipients who didn't request them.
 * </p>
